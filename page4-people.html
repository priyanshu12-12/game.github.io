        <p class="sender">They too started running behind me.</p>
        <p class="sender">I got scared, i saw the building and entered the door.</p>
        <p class="sender">And hid in some room nearby. They too entered the house while searching me.</p>
        <p class="sender">As I saw the opportunity, I tried to escape the house. But, the door was locked, so I hid again. Now I am trapped inside along with those people.</p>
